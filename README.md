## Info
### **🛡️ Defense Points**
- DP gets reduced by 1 after every attack
- Before every attack, the attack damage is reduced with the amount of DP. That means if there is an attack of 5, and there is 1 DP, the damage will be 4.

### **💨 Speed**
- The higher the speed of the monster, the later the attack will happen.
- When a monster is having the speed of 10, and another one of 20, the one with 10 will attack first.

### **Arena Creation**
- A fight between monsters of the same breed is not possible
- When trying to create an fight that would make monsters of the same breed fight against eachother, the arena setup will be reset.
- You can just press ENTER to use the default stats when setting up the stats of a monster

### **TDM**
The TDM mode does NOT follow the restriction of "Sollte das Monster nach einer Attacke noch Lebenspunkte übrig haben führt dieses nun einen Angriff aus.
Dies wiederholt sich bis ein Monster stirbt.", because this would not make a good fight possible. The restriction is only applied to the 1v1 mode.

## Monsters
### **👻 Ghoul**
Fast and lethal monster, but touching it will cause it to die.
Only in TDM recommended

### **🧌 Ork**
The orks biggest strength is their stupidity. They will run into battle with no precaution and bonk the head of their enemies.

### **🪨 Cursed Rock**
This being will slowly nag down the HP of their enemies whilst being very, VERY tanky.

### **🧟 Hollow**
The soul of this creature has long faded, only leaving its shell back. Very fast and strong, but not very durable.
